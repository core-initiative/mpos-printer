- Support configuration via external files.
- Provide robust logging and error handling.
- Package as a standalone JAR with all dependencies.

## Goals
- Seamless integration with POS systems.
- Reliable and efficient printing operations.
- Maintainable and extensible codebase.
- Easy deployment and configuration.

## Scope
- Java 7+ compatibility (upgrade recommended).
- Use of open-source libraries for PDF, barcode, WebSocket, and configuration management.
- Unit testing with JUnit.
- Logging with SLF4J and Logback.
