# Progress: mpos-printer

## What Works
- Swing GUI is fully implemented and is now the main entry point
- Start/Stop button controls the WebSocket server
- Real-time, scrollable log area displays all logs from all classes and threads
- Configuration can be edited via the GUI and saved to printer.properties
- All System.out.print calls have been replaced with logger calls
- LogbackTextAreaAppender is registered early, ensuring all logs appear in the GUI
- Logger output from all threads and startup code is visible in the GUI

## What's Left to Build
- Further GUI polish (log filtering, error highlighting, etc.)
- Additional configuration options if needed
- Optional: Remove console appender for GUI-only logging
- More extensive cross-platform and Java version testing

## Current Status
- The application is stable and user-friendly with a modern GUI
- All logging is centralized and visible to the user
- Java 8+ is now required for building and running the project

## Known Issues
- None critical; further polish and testing recommended
