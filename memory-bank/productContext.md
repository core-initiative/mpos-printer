# Product Context: mpos-printer

## Why This Project Exists
Modern POS systems require reliable, flexible, and efficient printing solutions for receipts, barcodes, and other documents. Existing solutions may lack integration flexibility, real-time communication, or support for modern formats (PDF, barcode, etc.).

## Problems It Solves
- Simplifies integration of printing capabilities into POS systems.
- Provides a unified solution for printing receipts, barcodes, and PDFs.
- Enables real-time communication with printers or backend services via WebSockets.
- Centralizes configuration and logging for easier maintenance and troubleshooting.

## How It Should Work
- The application receives print jobs (possibly via WebSocket or direct invocation).
- It processes the job, formats the output (text, barcode, PDF), and sends it to the printer.
- Configuration files allow customization of printer settings and behavior.
- Logging provides traceability and error diagnostics.

## User Experience Goals
- Fast and reliable printing with minimal user intervention.
- Easy configuration and deployment.
- Clear error reporting and logging.
- Extensible for future printing formats or protocols.
